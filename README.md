# Baden Württemberg Sticker

A datapack that adds the yellow stickers from Baden Württemberg as a map art to your Minecraft world.

## Installation
In order for the datapack to work, the map art first needs to be registered in your world. To do this download the [map_187.dat](map_187.dat) file and place it in your world folder in the data folder.

Then just add the datapack into the datapacks folder in your world folder and everything should work fine.
